# Calculation host RPC v1

**Status:** v1 wire contract — normative; executable transport conformance pending  
**Protocol:** JSON-RPC 2.0 over a local Windows named pipe

## 1. Process topology

`Renderer → allowlisted preload API → Electron main → named-pipe client → TypeScript calculation host`

A Python worker is deferred from v1. The v1 process topology is `Renderer → allowlisted preload API → Electron main → named-pipe client → TypeScript calculation host`.

- Renderer never opens a named pipe, launches a process, or chooses an executable path.
- Preload exposes a small allowlist of typed operations only.
- Electron main owns host startup, process verification, connection lifecycle, request forwarding, cancellation, health monitoring, and shutdown.
- TypeScript host is the named-pipe server and authoritative calculation service.

## 2. Transport framing

- Encoding: UTF-8.
- Payload: one JSON-RPC 2.0 object per frame.
- Framing: 4-byte unsigned length prefix followed by exactly that many UTF-8 bytes. **Byte order: little-endian.**
- Maximum frame payload: fixed 16 MiB for v1; peers do not negotiate or override it.
- Reject zero-length, oversized, truncated, malformed UTF-8, and invalid JSON frames.
- Read exactly the declared payload length; pipe read boundaries are not message boundaries.
- One request per frame; JSON-RPC batch arrays are not supported.
- No newline-delimited JSON and no delimiter scanning.

The little-endian prefix and fixed 16 MiB cap are normative v1 wire rules and MUST be encoded in shared fixtures. Changing either requires a protocol version change or explicit compatibility decision.

## 3. JSON-RPC rules

- JSON-RPC version field MUST be `"2.0"`.
- Requests MUST have a non-empty string or integer ID; notifications are limited to explicitly documented lifecycle events.
- Responses MUST echo the request ID.
- Unknown methods return `-32601`.
- Invalid request/envelope returns `-32600`.
- Invalid JSON returns `-32700`.
- Invalid method parameters return `-32602`.
- Internal errors use a reserved Khwarizmi error range and structured `data`.
- Batch requests are rejected.
- A response is returned exactly once for each request with an ID unless the connection fails.

## 4. Initial methods

| Method | Direction | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `host.getInfo` | request | protocol, host, semantic, and capability versions |
| `document.validate` | request | validate document/schema/AST and return diagnostics |
| `document.evaluate` | request | evaluate a document revision and return result records/traces |
| `$/cancelRequest` | notification | cancel an in-flight request by its JSON-RPC ID |

Method parameter and result objects MUST be schema-versioned and validated. Document-bearing calls include the canonical authored document and its SHA-256 JCS digest; the receiver recomputes it. `document.evaluate` returns Khwarizmi result records, never raw Compute Engine objects. Each result identifies original and substituted MathJSON, exact assignment-version dependencies, tagged scalar value, normalized unit/dimension, status, diagnostics, and engine/semantic/unit-registry versions. Do not accept arbitrary code, paths, engine snippets, or Python snippets as RPC parameters.

## 5. Evaluation result statuses

Document evaluation returns one of:
- `completed`: all requested calculations completed without error diagnostics;
- `completedWithErrors`: evaluation completed but one or more nodes contain errors;
- `cancelled`: caller cancellation was acknowledged and no further work for that request should be committed.

Transport/process failure is not an evaluation status; it is an RPC/transport error. Partial results must identify their node status and must not masquerade as a completed document.

## 6. Request cancellation and concurrency

- Cancellation is best-effort and idempotent.
- The host tracks in-flight request IDs.
- A cancellation notification for an unknown/completed ID is ignored.
- A cancelled request must not publish a completed result snapshot.
- Requests are isolated; no shared mutable document evaluation context between requests.
- Duplicate in-flight request IDs are rejected.
- Default host safeguards: 30 seconds for validation, 120 seconds for evaluation, and at most eight concurrent requests per host instance. Callers may cancel earlier; these limits are not a guarantee that all evaluations finish within the timeout.
- Timeout and concurrency behavior MUST be deterministic, documented, and covered by conformance fixtures.

## 7. Security and lifecycle

The named pipe is local-only and restricted to the current Windows user via a protected DACL. The host MUST reject remote clients and unexpected clients. Electron main MUST verify the spawned process identity/ownership and connect only to the pipe instance it created or securely discovered. Pipe names must be unpredictable per app instance or otherwise protected against squatting.

- Host starts with the desktop application and is owned by Electron main.
- Startup includes a bounded readiness/health handshake.
- Unexpected host exit fails in-flight calls with a transport error.
- Main process performs controlled shutdown and bounded termination.
- Do not expose a general-purpose pipe name or privileged process-launch method to renderer content.

Electron main MUST verify the spawned host process identity/ownership and bind readiness to a per-launch unguessable capability delivered through a protected channel, in addition to a restrictive DACL and unpredictable per-instance pipe name. The capability MUST NOT be exposed to renderer code or logs. Exact Windows API calls and ACL entries remain implementation details, but these security properties are normative and release-blocking.

## 8. Integrity and canonicalization

For document payload integrity, use SHA-256 over RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) bytes. The digest is an integrity/cache key, not an authorization mechanism. The receiver recomputes and verifies the digest over the exact canonical document payload and rejects mismatches. Do not hash ordinary JSON serialization with unspecified property order.

## 9. Python worker boundary

Python worker protocol, runtime dependency, and numerical operation catalog are deferred from v1. TypeScript remains authoritative and no Python worker is required for v1. A future worker, if approved under a separate ADR, must remain internal to the TypeScript host, use typed bounded requests, and cannot mutate the document, symbol table, or dependency graph.

## 10. Method schema references and response payloads

The v1 schemas are:
- `contracts/schemas/v1/rpc-envelope.schema.json`: closed JSON-RPC method/envelope union;
- `contracts/schemas/v1/rpc/host-get-info.schema.json`: `host.getInfo` result;
- `contracts/schemas/v1/rpc/document-validate.schema.json`: `document.validate` params;
- `contracts/schemas/v1/document-validation-result.schema.json`: `document.validate` result;
- `contracts/schemas/v1/rpc/document-evaluate.schema.json`: `document.evaluate` params;
- `contracts/schemas/v1/rpc/cancel-request.schema.json`: cancellation params;
- `contracts/schemas/v1/evaluation-result.schema.json`: `document.evaluate` result.

The document-validation result is a versioned object containing document ID/revision, schema and semantic versions, a boolean validity flag, and ordered diagnostics. A validation request MUST NOT execute any expression. Evaluation results contain per-statement original expression records, substituted MathJSON, typed scalar values, units, assignment-version dependencies, per-occurrence substitution provenance, control-flow path, node status, and diagnostics. Engine-specific object instances MUST be normalized before serialization.

A request ID is a non-empty string or non-negative safe integer. The error response may use a null ID only when the request could not be parsed or correlated; successful responses always echo the original request ID. Responses contain exactly one of `result` or `error`. Cancellation is a notification and has no response of its own.

## 11. Contract completion boundary

The method schemas and language-neutral fixtures are part of the contract definition. They do not constitute a tested named-pipe implementation. Framing, Windows ACL/process verification, cancellation races, concurrency enforcement, and digest implementation remain executable conformance work.

## 12. Platform implementation details

These platform details remain implementation deliverables, not open owner approvals. The fixed 16 MiB limit, little-endian framing, process verification, and per-launch capability are normative.
